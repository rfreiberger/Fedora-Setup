# My Vim setup

## Vim Package Mananagers

I recently switched from using [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). There's no real benefit, but I'm finding more packages under Vundle than Vim Plug. 

## Finding Packages

The best location is [Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com) for finding packages. 

## My favorites 

These are all found from Vim Awesome, and work great for my basic setup. 

Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'bling/vim-airline'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plugin 'dracula/vim'
